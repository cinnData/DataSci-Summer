# [DS-04] Basic stats in Pandas

## Importing data from CSV files

Data sets in tabular form can be imported as Pandas data frames from many file formats. In particular, data from a CSV file can be imported to a data frame with the Pandas function `read_csv`(). The (default) syntax is `dfname = pd.read_csv(fname)`. The data frame name is chosen by the user, and the file name has to contain the **path** of that file (either local or remote). `read_csv()` works the same way for CSV files and for **zipped ZIP files**.

Although defaults work in most cases satisfactorily, it is worth to comment a few things about some optional arguments of `read_csv()`. The list is not complete, but enough to give you an idea of the extent to which you can customize this function.

* The parameter `sep` specifies the column separator. The default is `sep=','`, but CSV files created with Excel may need `sep=';'`.

* The parameters `header` and `names` specify the row where the data to be imported start and the column names, respectively. The default is `header=0, names=None`, which makes Pandas start reading from the first row and take it as the column names. When the data come without names, you can use `header=None, names=namelist` to provide a list of names. With a positive value for `header`, you can skip some rows.

* The parameter `index_col` specifies a column that you wish to use as the index, if that is the case. The default is `index_col=None`. If the intended index comes in the first column, as it frequently happens, you will use `index_col=0`.

* The parameter `usecols` specifies the columns to be read. You can specify them in a list, either by name or by position. The default is `usecols=None`, which means that you wish to read all the columns.

* The parameter `dtype` specifies the data types of the columns of the data frame. This saves time with big data sets. The default is `dtype=None`, which means that Python will guess the data type, based on what it reads. When all the entries in a column are numbers, that column is imported as numeric. If there is, at least, one entry that is not numeric, all the entries are read as strings, and the data type `object` is assigned to that column.

* If the string data contained in a CSV file can contain special characters (such as ñ, or á), which can make trouble, you may need to control the parameter `encoding`. The default is `encoding='utf-8'`. So, if you are reading a CSV file created in Excel, you may need to set `encoding='latin'` to read the special characters in the right way.

## Summary statistics

The method `.describe()` extracts a conventional statistical summary. Columns of type `object` are omitted, except when all the columns have that type. Then the report contains just counts. 

Basic statistics can also be calculated separately. For instance, ther method `.mean()` returns the column means. Correlations are also pretty easy:

* For a pair of series, `s1` and `s2`, `s1.corr(s2)` returns the **correlation** of `s1` and `s2`.

* For a data frame `df`, `df.corr()` returns the **correlation matrix** for the columns of `df`.

## Plotting

We typically visualize the data with bar plots, histograms, scatter plots and line plots. They can be obtained directly from a Pandas object. Suppose first that `df` is a Pandas data frame and set `cname1` as the *x*-column and `cname2` as the *y*-column (numeric). To explore the dependence of the *y*-column on the *x*-column, we use a **bar plot**, when the *x*-column is categorical, and a **scatter plot**, when it is numeric:

* `df.plot.bar(x=cname1, y=cname2)` returns a bar plot. The bars represent the values of the column `cname2` for the different values of the column `cname1`. If you do not specify the *x*-column, the index is used instead.

* `df.plot.scatter(x=cname1, y=cname2)` returns a scatter plot.

Suppose now that `s` is a numeric Pandas series. To explore the distribution of `s`, you use a **histogram**. Alternatively, to explore a trend, you use a **line plot**. This is pretty easy in Pandas:

* `s.plot.hist()` returns a histogram.

* `s.plot.line()` returns a line plot.

Pandas uses Matplotlib functions, but not explicitly. If you are satisfied with a basic functionality, you can skip Matplotlib in your code.
